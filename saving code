       delicous foods everyday,</p2>

    <h2> A Brief History of Mexican Dishes</h2>

    <p id="p4">
        Mexican cuisine has its roots in the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica, including the Olmecs, Maya, and Aztecs.</p4>
        <p id="p5">Utilizing ingredients such as maize, cacao, squash, beans, chili peppers, and tomatoes.</p5> 
        <p id="p6">The Spanish conquest in the 16th century brought new ingredients such as beef, pork, rice, and new fruits and vegetables.</p6> 
         <p id="p7"> This new fusion of foods is known as "mestiza". Over the centuries many cultures have influenced Mexican cuisine. </p7>  
        <p id="p8"> From African influences to Middle Eastern, Mexican food has blended these cultures into their own unique cuisine that reflects their resilience and creativity.</p8>
