			<ul>
				<li id="In1">1 cup Long Grain White Rice (Do Not Rinse)</li>
				<li id="In2">1 8oz can of Tomatoe Sauce (+ 2 1/4 cans of water: Save that can!)</li>
				<li id="In3">1 Tblsp of Oil ( I prefer Olive Oil, but use what you like)</li>
				<li id="In4">1 tsp Chicken Boullion</li>
				<li id="In6">1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
				<li id="In7">1/2 Tblsp Onion Powder</li>
				<li id="In8">1 tsp salt or to taste</li>
			</ul>

			<li id="l1">Place rice in a sauce pan with the Olive oil and mix until rice turns glossy and opaque. Place pan
				on a medium high heat and "toast" the rice. You are going to toast until the rice turns white again and 
				starts to turn slightly brown. When the rice is done toasting, it will smell slightly nutty.
				</li>
				
				<li id="l2">When the rice is slightly brown and smells slightly nutty, pour in the can of tomatoe sauce (be careful to not burn yourself, it can splatter) 
					and 2 full cans of water and stir. (Save the can, you will need it later!)
				</li>
				
				<li id="l3"> To the sauce add the chicken boullion, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Stir and taste broth.
					Adjust seasonings according to your taste. These measurements are perfect for my tastes, but you may want more garlic.
					Do not add more salt, if needed, until it is almost done.
				</li>
			
				<li id="l4">Once it is boiling, reduce heat to simmer and cover with lid. Allow to simmer for 15 minutes. Stirring occasionally
					to avoid rice sticking to the bottom. 
				</li>
				
				<li id="l5">After 15 minutes, remove lid and taste. If rice is a tiny bit firm, add the remaining 1/4 can of water, stir, replace lid and remove from heat.
					Allow to sit for 5 minutes more. Rice should be firm but not dry. (This step is a bit of a preferance, some like it
					more softer, and some like it a bit firmer, aldente if you will. Keep that can of extra water if you need it, the rice will
					continue to soak up little bits while its still warm.) 
				</li>

				<li id="l6">Serve with your entree and enjoy! Rice will keep in the fridge for 2-3 days.</li>
