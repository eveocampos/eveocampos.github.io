    <h1> Mexican Dishes To Try </h1>

    <p>
       As a self proclaimed FOODIE I have tried many different cuisines. I love food, and I love trying new foods.
       One of my all time favorite cuisines is Mexican, and not only because I am Mexican and grew up eating these
       delicous foods everyday, but because they are truly delicious. I have compiled several recipes here that 
       anyone can make, from the novice cook to the seasoned veteran. Give them a try today!

    <h2> A Brief History of Mexican Dishes</h2>

    <p>
        Mexican cuisine has its roots in the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica, including the Olmecs, Maya, and Aztecs.
        Utilizing ingredients such as maize, cacao, squash, beans, chili peppers, and tomatoes. The Spanish conquest in 
        the 16th century brought new ingredients such as beef, pork, rice, and new fruits and vegetables. This new fusion of foods is known
        as "mestiza". Over the centuries many cultures have influenced Mexican cuisine from African influences to Middle Eastern.
        Mexican food has blended these cultures into their own unique cuisine that reflects their resilience and creativity.
