				<li id="l1">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking trays with baking paper.</li>
				<li id="l2">Using a stand mixer on medium speed, cream the butter and sugar together for about 
					3 minutes until soft and pale. Add the egg and mix for a further minute. 
					Add the flour and mix with a rubber spatula until just combined, then beat thoroughly. 
					Stir in the chocolate chips or raisins.</li>
				<li id="l3">If you have time, cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour before baking. Roll the dough 
					into walnut-sized balls and arrange on the trays, leaving space between them as they will
					spread during baking.</li>
				<li id="l4">Bake for about 12 minutes, or until the cookies are firm and golden brown at the edges. 
					Leave to cool on the baking trays; the cookies will firm further as they cool.</li>
