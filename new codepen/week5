    <h1>Let's Learn About UX</h1>

    <p>UX? UI? UXD? UID? UCD? What are all these? Are they parts of web design? Are they the same thing or different things? In these lessons, we start exploring user experience (UX) topics using the 5-level paradigm from the book <em>The Elements of User Experience, Second Edition</em>, by J. J. Garrett. (You are not required to own this book.)</p>

  <p>Over readings and videos, we will:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>get an overview of the 5 levels of UX (as defined by Garrett)</li>

    <li>learn why we are doing something defines the foundational strategy for the rest of the web design project</li>

    <li>hear how a clear scope can help design projects</li>

    <li>look at different types of content organization and information structures for pages and for navigation</li>

    <li>listen to different UX and UI professionals talk about their fields</li>

  </ul>

  <p>There are four lesson videos this week, with a total runtime under two hours. After finishing those, complete the four required Activities this week: three are "quests" and one is an online card sort. There is also an extra-credit Activity.</p>
