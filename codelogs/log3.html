    Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries
</h1>

<h2>
    How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?
</h2>
<p>
Media queries are part of 'responsive' web design that allows you to create different layouts according to the size
of the viewport or screen. Queries will also respond to other elements that are running, such as touch screen or mouse use.  Media querries
will, for example, adjust what the user sees according what device and browser they are using if they meet a specific
rule you have specified (ex: if viewpoint is less than 600 pixels). Media querries can even be used to adjust to the orientation 
of the device, landscape vs portrait.

So why is it useful?
