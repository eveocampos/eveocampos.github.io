    Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries
</h1>

<h2>
    How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?
</h2>
<p>
Media queries are part of 'responsive' web design that allows you to create different layouts according to the size
of the viewport or screen. Queries will also respond to other elements that are running, such as touch screen or mouse use.  Media querries
will, for example, adjust what the user sees according what device and browser they are using if they meet a specific
rule you have specified (ex: if viewpoint is less than 600 pixels). Media querries can even be used to adjust to the orientation 
of the device, landscape vs portrait. 
</p>
<p>
So why is it useful? Media querries are useful for several reasons; they allow you to make your design flexible,
user-friendly, and easily maintainable. Queries allow you to create a design that adapts across multiple output devices 
without having to use more than one codebase. It also allows those multiple outputs to remain optimized depending on
what output device they are using, eliminating a 'heavy' layout if the device is small, such as a phone.
</p>
<h3>
Four "media features" supported by media queries and they do?
</h3>
<p>
   <ul>
    <li>
Width and Height: Defines the height and width of the viewport via a specific number (e.g. 650px) or via a range (using min-height or width and 
                  max-height or width).
    </li>
    <li>
Orientation: Allows the layout to adjust based on the orientation of the viewport, portrait (tall) or landscape (wide).
    </li>
    <li>
Use of Pointing Devices: Using the "hover" media feature you can test to see if the user is using a pointing device that hovers
                         over an element. Only a pointing device such as a mouse can hover; touchscreen and keyboard navigation
                         cannot.
    </li>
    <li>
Aspect-Ratio: Defines the width-to-height aspect ratio of the viewport. This can be done using aspect-ratio, min-aspect-ration,
               or max-aspect-ratio (no pixels are used only fractions). This means that no matter how the size changes (bigger or smaller) CSS will keep the
               shape proportion.
    </li>
   </ul>
