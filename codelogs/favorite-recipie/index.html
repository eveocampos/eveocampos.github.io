			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>3.5 oz lightly salted butter, at room temperature</li>
				<li>4.5 oz oz soft light brown or golden sugar</li>
				<li>1 large egg</li>
				<li>6 oz self raising flour</li>
				<li>3.5 oz chocolate chips, dark or milk</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Directions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking trays with baking paper.</li>
				<li>Using a stand mixer on medium speed, cream the butter and sugar together for about 
					3 minutes until soft and pale. Add the egg and mix for a further minute. 
					Add the flour and mix with a rubber spatula until just combined, then beat thoroughly. 
					Stir in the chocolate chips or raisins.</li>
				<li>If you have time, cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour before baking. Roll the dough 
					into walnut-sized balls and arrange on the trays, leaving space between them as they will
					spread during baking.</li>
				<li>Bake for about 12 minutes, or until the cookies are firm and golden brown at the edges. 
					Leave to cool on the baking trays; the cookies will firm further as they cool.</li>
			</ol>
