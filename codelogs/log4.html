    Code Log 3: CSS Color
</h1>

<h2>
    How does CSS use color?
</h2>
<p>
	CSS uses color CSS uses color to style elements on a webpage such as the text color, backgrounds, borders,
	shadows, etc. When referring to the color property or data type, CSS uses color to set the text and text decorations of
	an element.
	It also sets the currentColor value. Another CSS color property is background-color. This CSS proprty sets the
	background color behind an element. CSS also uses border-color, which sets the color of an elements border.
</p>
<h3>
	How does CSS accept color as a value?
</h3>
<p>
	CSS accepts as a value through the use of different legal methods or formats. You can use such formats as the hexadecimal
	notation. Hexadecimal notation is a notation used for dexcribing the hexadecimal color syntax of a Standard RGB
	color as well as it's transparency. CSS can also use keywords, such as Named color, which uses the name of the color
	such as red, blue, green. The RGB function uses the rgb(red,green,blue) syntax to define the intensity of the color
	using an integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage value (from 0% to 100%). Finally, contrast-color is another function
	or method that can be used to specify a color that you want a contrasting color returned for. These are only a few
	examples of how CSS accepts color as a value.
