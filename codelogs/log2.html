<h1>Code Log 2: What is the difference between "absolute" and "relative" CSS length units?</h1>


<p>
When using CSS length is a numeric unit that resides under the "dimensions" data type umbrella.  
This unit tells the browser how big something shold be, such as font size.  There are two types of length; "absolute"
and "relative".
</p>

<p>
Absolute length is a 'fixed' length, it is not relative to anything else.  This length stays the same across 
all platforms and is better for print rather then screen display.

Realtive lenth is "not fixed" and is relative to something else such as the parent element or the the root element.
This length is flexible and scalable and allows for the units to scale realtive to everything else on the page,
which is very useful for screen output as it will scale across different devices.
