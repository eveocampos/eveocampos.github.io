<h1>Code Log 2: What is the difference between "absolute" and "relative" CSS length units?</h1>


<p>
When using CSS length is a numeric unit that resides under the "dimensions" data type umbrella.  
This unit tells the browser how big something shold be, such as font size.  There are two types of length; "absolute"
and "relative".
</p>

<p>
Absolute length is a 'fixed' length, it is not relative to anything else.  This length stays the same across 
all platforms and is better for print rather then screen display.
</p>

<p>
Realtive lenth is "not fixed" and is relative to something else such as the parent element or the the root element.
This length is flexible and scalable and allows for the units to scale realtive to everything else on the page,
which is very useful for screen output as it will scale across different devices.
</p>

<p>
Here are three CSS length units:
<ul>
	<li>em and rem: these are relative length units. em is realative to the font size of the parent element.
    	rem is realtive to the root element (html) not the parent. Both em and rem are often used to create 
	    scalable layouts, which maintain the vertical spacing of the page even if the user changes the font size.
	</li>
	<li>
		px and pt: these are absolte length units. px (pixel) is relative to the screens display and represents one device
		pixel (dot), it is the physical reference pixel. px is scaled for devices and commonly used in webdesign. 
		pt (point) is used for print media and is a physical unit where 1pt = 1/72 of an inch. 
	</li>
	<li>
		percentage: percentage is a realative length unit. It is always relative to another value such as a parent 
		element's font size, width, height, etc. Percentages make design flexible and responsive. 
	</li>
</ul>
