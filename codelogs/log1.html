	<h1> Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p> What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML? 

            In HTML, there are both non-semantic tags and semantic tags.  I will briefly explain the difference 
            between both.  Semantic tags are, put simply descriptive tags.  These tags tell the browser and the 
            developer what content they hold.This makes it easier to maintain the organization and structure of 
            the webpage you are designing.  Here are some examples of semantic tags:

            <textarea col="20" row="5"><header>, <footer>, <article></textarea>
             
            Non-semantic tags do not tell you any information about what they hold; they instead are used to 
            create the style or layout of the content they hold.  Examples of such tags are:

            <textarea cols="20" rows="5"><div>, <span>, <b></b></textarea>
        
        
        
        What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags? 

            Two benefits of using semantic tags are: firstly, using semantic tags you have more consistent code. 
            Each programmer will write code slightly differently using non-semantic tags; however, with semantic 
            tags it is streamlined and consistent. Secondly, the use of semantic code is easier to read and maintain.  
            Using non-semantic tags can get crowded and overwhelming to see visually. </p>
